This is the part I care most about being in the kernel docs. Eg: what
configs to use. What commandline params to set. Dos and Don'ts for the
drivers, etc. So, good to see that is an acceptable option.

Makes sense.

A lot of kernel params are arch specific and we still document them in
the kernel. So I don't there's some leeway. But yeah, doesn't make
sense to document stuff like "improve RPi 4 boot time" kinds of stuff
in the kernel. But not sure that makes sense for the elinux.org wiki
either. But we can figure this out as we go.

At least for the kernel params and configs, I don't think it's that
adhoc. The rest, I don't have an opinion.

In all the companies I've worked at, there's always been some level of
sanity check about external contributions to make sure you aren't
accidentally/intentionally signing up the company for something the
company doesn't agree with.

The point is that I don't know what Google's position is wrt
elinux.org and I need to find it out and/or go through any paperwork
that might be necessary to get approval. All that adds a lot of
inertia, at least for me. I know we are okay contributing to LMKL, so
that makes kernel docs a frictionless process from an approval
perspective. And with the other points in mind about bit rot and
keeping things in sync with kernel, I'd prefer the kernel parts of it
being in the kernel docs.

My comment wasn't about this part at all. I don't think boot timing
needs to be run on any unreleased device. There are plenty of released
devices to test with. And we are actively adding Pixel 6 support to
upstream.
