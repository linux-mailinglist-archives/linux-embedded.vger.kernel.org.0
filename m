Buffering or not in the char device is a driver choice. If your serial 
hardware has a small FIFO buffer and the driver doesn't do its own layer 
of output buffering (with a tasklet or something to copy the data to the 
hardware), then the write() syscall will block waiting for the data to 
go out. (Writes to filesystems stopped doing this back around 2.0 or 
something, when they rewrote the vfs to be based on the page cache and 
deentry cache, meaning ALL filesystem writes go through that now unless 
you say O_DIRECT to _ask_ for it to block, which isn't even always 
honored. But for some reason the TTY layer drives people insane, and 
char devices have been given a wide berth...)

There's a similar issue with some xterms where "make -j16 build" 
spamming lots of output to a display terminal can run significantly 
slower than "make -j16 build | cat" because the linux pipe 
infrastructure inserts a pipe buffer (ulimit -p says 8 but I think 
that's _pages_ so 32k? Except in 2.6.11 it was 64k? Eh, not looking it 
up...) so the writes from each cc instance go into the pipe buffer and 
return immediately when it's not full, whereas writes to a terminal 
device block until the terminal has finished updating (which includes 
scrolling the screen).

If I recall (many years ago), the kde terminal implementation included a 
buffer of its own (immediately returned before updating), and the gnome 
one didn't (blocked until x11 display update completed), so foreground 
builds were faster under kde.

And the gnome guys' answer was to spray everything down with 3D 
acceleration so the GPU was scrolling the screen for you, because of 
course it was.

Anyway, serialized latency has _always_ killed throughput, because it's 
a cost you can't get BACK. The kernel guys used to know this:

https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/raid0.html

Hence the old high school math problem: if you have 2 hours to go 100 
miles and you travel the first 40 miles at 20 miles per hour, how fast 
do you have to go the rest to make it on time? Answer: you'd have to 
instantaneously teleport because you spent 2 hours going 40 miles and 
your time is up with 60 miles left to go. Optimizing the wrong part 
DOESN'T HELP.

You can adjust the loglevel so they still go into dmesg but don't go out 
to the console, which theoretically shouldn't be THAT slow? (At least 
cpu limited rather than wait-for-hardware.)

But keep in mind that a lot of kernel devs seem actively trying to 
sabotage embedded development, and the dmesg metadata is now multiple 
times the size of the actual payload.

https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2412.0/00045.html

So trimming the dmesg buffer size is probably ALSO a good idea on modern 
embedded systems, because WHAT THE FSCK? Also, I dunno how much cpu time 
all that metadata fapping takes. (Before systemd, this was just text 
going into a ring buffer. But systemd couldn't cope with that because 
https://www.theregister.com/2014/04/05/torvalds_sievers_dust_up/ and 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd#History and of course 
https://www.linux.com/news/fun-photo-greg-kroah-hartman-crowned-systemd-hackfest/ 
thus the data structures in the kernel had to become far more complex 
after about 30 years of NOT being like that, because systemd.)
