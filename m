Yeah looks like this is the case for RPi Zero W. I guess there is 
probably no buffer at all in the RPi serial driver / hw since every log 
line from systemd delays systemd for ~10ms (~80ms in baud9600 case).

Btw: I can confirm the same for RPi3 w/ four cores. Difference is that 
something seems to go on in kernel in parallel to logs writing to serial 
but at a certain point the kernel is waiting again for lot of seconds 
probably for the serial device to finish transmission. Systemds delay is 
pretty much similar to the single core case.

Absolutely correct.

With quiet logs go into dmesg as well.

But as said, i do not really see use cases to dump out these logs to a 
serial console in a boot time critical system on each production boot. 
Reading dmesg or systemd's journal after time critical things are done 
should be ok in most case.

So my recommendation to people who seek for fastboot potential:

* switch of kernel to console log during startup using quiet cmdline 
option if you don't need these logs over serial essentially

* if you need them, your (Rob) options could be applied reducing the 
effect as best as possible
