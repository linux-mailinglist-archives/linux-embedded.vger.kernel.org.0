WIFI & Bluetooth devices often use this firmware mechanism. And yes I 
agree, it looks a bit ** ugly** seeing the kernel loading a firmware 
file from /lib/firmware  searching it in the root file system w/o 
knowing the state of it during boot ... For WIFI and bluetooth I do not 
see a big issue here since I'd prevent putting such features on a 
critical chain by system design in any way since bringing them up and 
(re)connecting external devices is time consuming by nature. Nothing you 
shall need to wait for ...

Compiling in modules vs. loading them later from user space is a 
trade-off. The effect of putting stuff into modules is to keep the 
kernel small which helps you in the "unpacking & loading kernel" phase 
before the kernel is actually started. Having an 1MB unpacked kernel is 
significantly a difference to a 5MB one. On the other hand, my 
experience is that there is lot of overhead (CPU time and IO) loading 
modules from user space. So it really only makes sense, if you have 
drivers to load at a point in time during startup where you have enough 
time and resources left.

I agree. There is kind of dynamic device enumeration done by the kernel 
drivers anyway once loaded. Any data structures to devices are build up 
internally. Nothing you can save ...

I'm even not sure how devtmpfs can be combined w/ your static devnodes 
you created in any kind of persistent partition. And if you even can get 
the kernel accepting your partition to use as /dev, you need to have it 
writeable for the case of dynamics you might need (usb for instance) 
which does not really go well with a read only RFS ... You could ... 
overlay fs ... well no, I think this goes into a wrong direction -> too 
complicated ;)

To summarize from my point of view:

* It's worth talking a bit about the effect of udev and about alternatives

* "mdev" is surely worth being named as an potential option besides 
"selective triggering" and "static setup and moving triggers back in time"

* I wouldn't regard mknode as an real alternative in todays system

* In addition I can imagine is "modules loading" vs. "compiling in 
drivers" something which is worth mentioning

* Once I've access to the wiki, I can try to put these ideas into an 
initial structure filled up w/ info we discussed in this thread
