Hi Tim,

Thanks for organizing this and moving it forward! I'd be interested in
contributing to this effort as a lot of work I have done aligns with
the goals of this effort and boot time is of obvious value to Android.

Can we instead keep this all a part of the kernel docs instead of the
wiki? Couple of reasons for that:
- Since the instructions can be kernel version specific (as things
change), it makes sense to have the document synced with the kernel.
- It's one less account to maintain and less chores for you.
- One less business approval to get in terms of contributing to
external sources.
- Less chance of bit rot. As people make changes, the docs are right
there to go fix.

Thanks,
Saravana
