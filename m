Just on the DP/drm side I think the pieces are there, but might need some
polish:

- with drm_connector_helepr_funcs->detect_ctx and ->mode_valid_ctx you can
  temporarily steal a crtc for probing, and as long as you don't hold
  unrelated modeset locks userspace shouldn't notice. This goes back to
  crt/vga load detection where some hw needed drivers to light up a full
  crtc. There's also the entire drmGetConnector vs drmGetConnectorCurrent
  to avoid such potentially expensive probe steps and just reuse cached
  values.

- if you can't get a crtc for probing there's the "unknown" connector
  status. We could perhaps sharpen the semantics of this (like officially
  documenting that reprobing with all other crtc switched off sometimes
  helps), but it's there. I'm also not super worried about this case
  because we don't have any available crtc anymore, so even if we can
  probe there's no way to light it up without disabling some other stuff.
  And as soon as you disable other stuff you can probe everything again
  (with the fixed locking of the ->detect/mode_valid_ctx callbacks)

- for the crtc assignment issue there's either drivers virtualizing them,
  or userspace doing combinatorial probes. Personally I'm leaning towards
  drivers having to virtualize crtcs (and then you can peak the least one
  that works, which I think should sort this out), but it's an open and
  getting discussed in other areas (like having to steal crtc for
  dual-pipe outputs). We might get a proper documentation patch with an
  actual kernel/compositor api contract here.

For the larger issue my only uninformed take is ... smells like too much
midlayer.

Like you'll certainly get some raised eyebrows if you submit a DP driver
without using dp helpers since that's a proper standard. But if your hw
has half the DP stack in firmware and just can't be smashed into the drm
dp helpers we have then I think even that would make sense.

Plus we already have like 3 different generations of dp helpers anyway,
because getting helpers right is kinda hard.

I dropped some unstructured replies with the same stuff on there too
first.
