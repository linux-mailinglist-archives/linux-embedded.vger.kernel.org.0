I'm just going through the "userspace application speed-up" parts in the 
wiki.


To the udev stuff ("Avoid udev, it takes ..." and "If you still like udev"):

* both hints seem to be a bit old fashioned to me taking the kernels 
devtmpfs into account

* In my experience, device nodes are created by the kernel today, I 
never needed to use any kind of mknod call anymore

* udevs job today is mostly about

     - setup of access rights and user and group ids of device nodes

     - creating symlinks (e.g. for partitions named w/ their UUIDs, ...)

     - loading kernel modules

     - annotating metadata to uevents for interested userspace applications

* In any way, udev is still very expensive when used the conventional way

     - Once udev is started, a trigger is send (by 
systemd-udev-trigger.service or udevadm trigger, for those who don't 
like systemd ;)) through the whole device tree to let all devices sent 
uevents again so that udev can work on each device. This causes massive 
CPU load for e few seconds you don't want to spend so early in the morning.

* There are options like selective triggering or moving the trigger back 
in time and do the setup manuelly ...

So I think it is worth talking a bit about udev and options to deal with 
it but adapting thinks a bit to todays world. I'm currently registering 
for the wiki, maybe I can setup an initial page at some time ...

Btw: If I'm wrong with my experiene about devtmpf and mknode, please 
correct me. And feel free to add other ideas to cope w/ udev in context 
of startup time critical systems ...

Regards,

Marko
