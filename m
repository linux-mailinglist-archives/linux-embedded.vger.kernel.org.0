Ok sounds good. IÂ  don't have really a place to publish data, so would 
be good if you can find a way ...

Take a look into the kmesg logs. Looks like there is a 8s delay at a 
certain point:

Not sure if it really makes sense to dig further into this issue. Might 
be something in the serial driver of the RPI. I don't see really a valid 
use case, 9600 baud is nothing you really need and in anyway pushing 
serial logs out via serial is nothing really needed in productive use 
cases, just for development (correct me if I'm wrong).

unit -> systemd unit

* grid size per minor grid line is 100ms to me (1s per main grid line -> 
see top of plot)

* take two units "user.slice" and "remote-fs.target"

* they should have basically no delay between each other -> you can see 
it in quiet case

* w/ serial on, you see delays (10ms, 80ms) which in fact are caused 
just by dropping the log lines to serial kernel log

* overall delay in user space startup sums up significantly

Yes I agree. Let me check out other boards and especially multi-core 
systems if the issues is happening there as well ...
